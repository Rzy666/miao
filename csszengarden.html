  View source is a feature , not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and interest in participating!

Here the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:


- CSS3?Of course!Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
- go responsive:test your layout at multipe screen sizes.
-your browser testing baseline"IE9+,recent Chrome/Firegox/Safari, and IOS/Androrid
- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
-use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted
services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
most that require custom HTML won't. Typekit is supported, see the readme on this
page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

And a few tips on bulilding your CSS file:

- use :first-child,:last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
- use :before and ::after to create paseudo-elements fir extre styling
- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
- use yhe Kellum Method for image replacement, if stikk needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdL
- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom .Use ::after instead.

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2”>CSS 1&amp; 2</abbr> usage.<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3&amp;4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported element only, or strong fallbacks should be ptovided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing publice. The only real requirement we have is that your《abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>validates.</p>
            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see faorly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especoally when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. The&#8217;s okay,but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ amd the latest Chrome ., Firefox, IOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyroght laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well [past the point of needing another garden-related desgin.</p>
            <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graohics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http:"www.mezzpblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>, but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative cimmons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site </a>so that others may learn from your work.
