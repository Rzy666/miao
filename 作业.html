  View source is a feature , not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and interest in participating!

Here the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:


- CSS3?Of course!Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
- go responsive:test your layout at multipe screen sizes.
-your browser testing baseline"IE9+,recent Chrome/Firegox/Safari, and IOS/Androrid
- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
-use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted
services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
most that require custom HTML won't. Typekit is supported, see the readme on this
page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

And a few tips on bulilding your CSS file:

- use :first-child,:last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
- use :before and ::after to create paseudo-elements fir extre styling
- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
- use yhe Kellum Method for image replacement, if stikk needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdL
- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom .Use ::after instead.
